## General info


<p align="center">
FeadMeApp is a degree project for my education as a Frontend Developer at the Media Institute. The project's frontend is built in React, the backend in Node.js and MySQL. The database is built in PhpMyAdmin. Right now I'm using the "themealdb" API to get recipe search results. But I also start collecting my own recipes and build my own API. These recipes are presented under "categories on the Home page". The database with these recipes is currently hard-coded in separate files under the Backend folder
